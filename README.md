**Project: Development of a Machine Learning Model to Predict Car Purchase Likelihood**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model aimed at predicting the probability of a customer purchasing a car, based on demographic and financial data.<br>
It is an active part of my ongoing training as a Machine Learning Engineer, serving as a practical exercise to strengthen my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The dataset (`data.csv`), available in the project repository, includes various features that will be used to inform the prediction model.

- **Independent Variables (Feature)**:  
  - Country  
  - Age  
  - Salary
- **Dependent Variables (Target)**:  
  - Car Purchased (Binary outcome indicating whether a customer has purchased a car)

This model development is in progress and serves as an integral component of my learning process, specifically targeting skills needed for machine learning deployment and optimization.
